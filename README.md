# aconomy #

A PHP application to share things in real life.

Aconomy stands for [another/alternative/anarchist] economy. Instead of always buying something when we need something,
we could share our ressources with our peer-groups. Everybody can constribute and everybody can profit from it:
Material, social and envirometal.
